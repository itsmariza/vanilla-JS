# vanilla-JS
This project is made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.
I learned this from ZTM'S Javascript Web Projects by Andrei Neagoie and Jacinto Wong.
To get the quotes;
The API is fetched with Async function -> try and catch method. 
Since I hid the API key, this syntax is commented out.
So for this project, the quotes are fetched from an internal js file : ownquotes.js
